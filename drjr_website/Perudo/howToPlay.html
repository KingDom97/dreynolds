            <h1>The Rules</h1>
            <p>The aim of the game is to be the last remaining player with any dice</p>
            <p>The game is played in rounds</p>
            <p>Each player must place a bet on how many of a dice they think there will be between all the players</p>
            <p>Aces (1) are wildcards, they count as any dice and so are included in the count at the end of a round</p>
            <p>If the bet is changed to aces, the number bet must be a minimum of half of the previous bet</p>
            <p>To end a round, a player calls "Dudo"</p>
            <p>"Dudo" is called when a player believes that the previous bet is unlikely</p>
            <p>If their call is correct, the player that placed the bet loses a dice</p>
            <p>If they are wrong, the player that called "Dudo" loses a dice</p>
            <p>When a player is reduced to one dice, the next round is palifico and this player starts the betting</p>
            <p>In a palifico round the dice bet on remains the same and aces are no longer wildcards</p>
            <p>When a player runs out of dice, they are out of the game</p>
